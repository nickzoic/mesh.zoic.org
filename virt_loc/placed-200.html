<h2>Addendum: 200 Node Mesh</h2>

Typically, mesh routing algorithms are tested on a network
with nodes placed completely at random.  
Randomly assigning the locations of nodes is inefficient,
with large numbers of nodes required to provide complete 
coverage.  A high density of nodes is needed if the network
is not to be disjoint.
<p>
Instead, for this paper we have placed nodes randomly within
the restriction that the minimum
distance between any two nodes is half the range, and that
every node is placed within range of at least one neighbour.
This ensures a non-disjoint network with a limit on the
density of nodes and a limit on the number of neighbours
of any given node.  This kind of placement would be
typical where it is possible to select
the approximate position of a node but the exact position
depends on other factors such as the terrain.
The Virtual Localization algorithm can then be used to 
find an efficient routing map of the network.
<p>
Figure 2 shows a network constructed in this
manner, and illustrates the process of determining virtual
locations for each node in the network.  The area of interest is
one square kilometre, and the communication range is 100 metres.

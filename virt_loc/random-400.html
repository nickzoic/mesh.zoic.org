<h2>Addendum: 400-Node Random Mesh</h2>

A commonly used method for generating <em>N</em>-node random meshes is to
pick <em>N</em> random locations within a square area.  This method does nothing
to prevent disjoint networks being generated, but for a high density
of nodes this rarely occurs.  This random scattering of nodes is not
very realistic, although it might be similar to the distribution of
small, rugged sensor motes scattered from an aeroplane.
<p>
Capkun, et al.<A HREF="#CAPKUN">[1]</A> use this model, randomly distributing
400 nodes in a 1km x 1km square, and varying the link range to
90, 100 or 110m to tune network connectivity.
<p>
Once the nodes are placed, topological
information is extracted and the original location information is forgotten.
Figure 1 shows the result of placing 400 nodes in a
square kilometre, with a link range of 100m.  Snapshots of the virtual
location of active nodes are shown for 1000, 2000 and 3000 elapsed
milliseconds, and at bottom right is a representation of the 
actual layout of the network which was used to create the topology.
<p>
Some features of the original network are visible in the virtual
layout, but it's not very clear.  A more important metric of the
performance of the algorithm is the number of routable nodes.  
Once the network has converged, 97% of nodes are routeable, with
only 12 nodes, in a group at the center right, remaining unroutable.
These nodes are well-located, so a more sophisticated location-based
routing scheme should
be able to determine routes to and from these nodes.

<em>Figure 1: Nodes progressively discover their virtual locations (seen
here at A: 1000, B: 2000 and C: 3000 ms) until
the entire network has been virtually mapped.
The root node is marked with a square, unrouteable nodes with circles.
Note that these are 2D projections of the 3D virtual
location, and have been manually rotated for clarity.  The original
2D topology is included as D for comparison purposes.}</em>
